### Purpose

A website that showcases my applications to perspective employers.  It contains an about me to tell the employer a little bit about my experiences throughout my life.  There is also a work section showing what my applications look like and link to the applications page as well.  Followed by a contact section, including phone number, email, and some professional social sites.  I used a nature looking background to incoporate my love for nature.

To see the webpage go to (https://duncanmarten.github.io/Portfolio/).
